  <p>
   The project is coming along well. I can say I finished almost 85% in accordance to my schedule of the total project. Before the holiday season I was able to complete project for this semester. I have repeatedly tested power up and connected all components together along with the program code and successfully extracted the student number from the student card. The above process was going smoothly, and I didn’t encounter any huge issue while I was working on it.
 </P>
  <p>
Regarding my financial situation, I did save some money from not buying the Gold CR80 PVC Cards because I was able to read the information from the college student card, that saved me $24.</P>
<P>
At this time, I’m working on the presentation and build instructions and I hope that it gets done before the submission next week.

        <li>I am working on Magnetic strip card reader, it as a part of a barcode reader project for Humber parts crib.
In order to build the project, I will need the following parts: screen, keyboard and mouse,  will be used in the project as output input  devices and , Roseberry pi 3 as operation system,  Magnetic Strip Card Reader, I will mount the Pi on the back of the screen and student card for testing,. Now I will assemble the parts together and power-on the system. After that, I will run the code and pass the card in the magnetic reader to get the data from it to display the result. As you see, we have successfully extracted the student number from the card’s using the magnetic strip.
